# The 'let' method will create a reusable object while the 'subject' method creates only one object which is meant to be an instance of the main object being tested.

# NOTE: 'let' method is lazy. It means that the object wonâ€™t be created until the first time you use it. To avoid these side-effects, use the 'let!' method which is non-lazy. So the object will be created before any tests are run.
